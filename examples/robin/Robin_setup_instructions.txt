## INSTRUCTIONS FOR OBTAINING THE ROBIN VEGETATION MODEL EXECUTABLE
Please note that Robin is currently only supported on Linux/Unix systems. For Windows users, please ensure you can
run Linux either as a virtual machine or a subsystem in order to proceed with steps 1-4.

###
For Windows users: please follow step 0 if Linux is not set up on your machine. If you do not have administrative 
access, please contact your IT department for assistance.

STEP 0.1: Enable Windows Subsystem for Linux (tested on Windows 10)
Open "Settings" (hit the Windows key and type "settings" in your search bar) and navigate to "Apps".
In the top right corner, click "Programs and Features" under "Related settings".
A window called "Programs and Features" will pop up. On the left panel, click "Turn Windows features on or off".
Another window called "Windows Features" will pop up. Scroll down and check the Feature called "Windows Subsystem for Linux".
Click "Ok".
Restart your computer for the changes to take effect. This feature must be enabled to run Linux.

STEP 0.2: Download and install a Linux terminal (tested on Windows 10)
There are a variety of terminal applications that can help interface with Linux/Unix.

We recommend Ubuntu, which is compatible with Windows Subsystem for Linux.
It can be downloaded here: https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/ubuntu-on-windows#4-install-ubuntu-for-windows-10

Another option (which doesn't require administrative access to operate) is VirtualBox.
It can be downloaded here: https://www.virtualbox.org/

Before executing scripts, please ensure input files (i.e., parameters.dat, ___run__eee.sh) are formatted to Linux/Unix line endings (LF).
To check the format, run the following command in the Linux terminal:

file [ name of file ]

To change the format, run the following command in the Linux terminal:

dos2unix [ name of file ]

The workflow will not execute if line endings are formatted to the Windows system (CRLF)!

STEP 1:
Download the source code library from the Robin github repository: https://github.com/dustming/Crop_Growth_Library
On your terminal, the command is: 
git clone https://github.com/dustming/Crop_Growth_Library.git

STEP 2:
Compile the source code into an executable on your local machine.
On your terminal, the commands are:

cd /path_to_crop_growth_library/makefile/	# get to the makefile subfolder
make clean					# clears previously compiled files
make raven_robin				# compiles source code into executable specific to your machine

The generated executable will be in the makefile subfolder.

STEP 3:
Copy the executable to the directory of your Robin (or Raven) model folder.

STEP 4:
Running Robin is identical to running Raven. On your terminal, the command is:

./raven_robin model_name -o output/
