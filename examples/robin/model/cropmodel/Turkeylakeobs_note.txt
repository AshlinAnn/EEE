## 1. Allometric equations
####################################
Allometric equations where M is mass in kg and D is diameter at breast height in cm:

Sugar maple:
Foliage mass (kg) = 0.1372*D^1.2603
Above ground total mass (kg) = 0.5005*D^2.0451

Yellow birch:
Foliage mass (kg) = 0.0554*D^1.5203
Above ground total mass (kg) = 0.3051*D^2.1417

Note that I've provided both sugar maple and yellow birch equations here. 
Prior to harvesting, the forest was dominated by sugar maple. 
Following harvesting pin cherry has been the primary tree species regenerating at this site. 
The yellow birch equations are the most suitable as a proxy for pin cherry.

## 2. Post-harvest vegetation observations

The two files are attached:

stockingBasalAreaVolume3132_1996to2013.csv: This has stocking (# stems/ha), basal area (m^2/ha) and 
biomass volume (m^3/ha) for c31 (clearcut) and c32 (unharvested reference) catchments. 
1996 is preharvest conditions and 1997-onwards are post-harvest conditions.

TLW_LAI.csv: This is a summary of LAI measurements (mean and standard deviations) made at the clearcut and unharvested 
reference catchments. 'Height' refers to the height above ground that LAI was measured: 
2 m effectively samples the overstory and 0.5 m samples the overstory and understory.
